          <h6>Quiz Grader Circuit</h6>
          <p>Honors Digital Electronics</p>
          <p>November 7, 2022 - November 30, 2022</p>
          <p>Background: In this project, my group had the goal of designing a circuit and building a breadboard from an
            AND-OR-invert (AOI) logic statement modeled after a real-world system. Our group decided to break down the
            logic and build a circuit on a quiz grader program that allowed teachers to save time on grading. I was
            responsible for building the "half-credit" circuit, which was the most logically intensive circuit and
            required the most logic gates. I designed this circuit in the simulation program, Multisim, and breadboarded
            it. All in all, this project has taught me how to <b>break down real-life situations into logic statements</b>, use
            that statement to <b>create a schematic on Multisim</b>, and use the Multisim to <b>design a breadboard in real life.</b>

          <p>May 2, 2022 - May 18, 2022</p>
          <p>Background: This project was my submission to the 2022 entrepreneurship competition where I had to team
            with a group of people to create a product that we could sell on the market. Our group's idea was to create
            a robot that could go into a forest and plant seeds to fight back against the 10 million hectares of forest
            that we lose every year. So to prove that the robot is implementable, I was tasked with building a program
            with an Arduino board that we could use to control the robot and plant seeds. I had <b>familiarized myself
              with the physical layout of the Arduino board</b> and figure out how to get the robot to move in the four
            cardinal directions. By the end of this project, I <b>learned how software could help combat climate
              change</b> and it also <b>sparked a newfound interest in circuity</b>.</p>

          <h6>Greenfoot Quizlet Board Game</h6>
          <p>Computer Science Applications</p>
          <p>July 18, 2021 - August 30, 2021</p>
          <p>Game: Players will roll dice to move around the board. When one player lands on a question tile, a question
            will display and that player will need to press the 1, 2, 3, or 4 keys. The goal of the game is to land
            exactly on the finish line.</p>
          <p>Background: The goal of this project was to create a two-player board game from scratch using the Greenfoot engine. The game includes has to include at least a 40-tile board with tiles that will display a question when a player lands on it. To win the game, the player has to land exactly at the finish line. This project <b>taught me to use object-oriented code that is easily expandable and flexible.</b> I also <b>learned how to read forums and get help with code online.</b></p>

          <p>Principles of Engineering</p>
          <p>February 10, 2021 - March 7,2021</p>
          <p>Background: The goal of this project was to create a product made out of recyclable materials that can be
            sold in the market. Every year, 250 million tons of trash are thrown away by America alone. If we can find
            other ways to reuse plastic, we can reduce the amount of trash polluting our oceans. In this project, I was
            responsible for making sure that deadlines are meet and that the documentation is presentable. <b>I learned
              how to set deadlines</b> and <b>manage a team of people</b>. Moreover, this project also <b>reminded me of
              the pollution problem on our planet</b>. If we continue to fill up our landfills at this rate; Eventually,
            we will run out of space to put our trash. For this reason, we must find new ways to limit our trash output
            and recycle when we can.</p>

          <h6>Compound Machine Project</h6>
          <p>Principles of Engineering</p>
          <p>November 9, 2020 - December 4, 2020</p>
          <p>Background: The goal of this project was to create a Rube Goldberg machine that can pull up a 250-pound
            weight, 2 feet in the air. A Rube Goldberg machine is a complex series of mechanisms that fulfill a simple
            task. In this project, I was responsible for animating two sections of the machine in the Unity engine. We
            had to compromise and build our machine virtually since we realized that we did not own any of the materials
            required to construct a physical machine. <b>I had to learn how to code in C#</b> and quickly <b>familiarize
              myself with the Unity interface</b> in a limited time frame. Overall, this project was a lot of fun since
            I learned more about programming and the Unity engine.</p>

          <p>Background: This project was built using Python and the Pillow library. The goal of this project was to
            modify images to satisfy a client's requirements; our client tasked us with creating borders around images.
            At the beginning of the project, I had trouble coding with the Pillow library and had to constantly look up
            the documentation. Through this process though, <b>I familiarized myself with the documentation and got
              better at researching</b>. Another lesson that I learned from this project was <b>how useful modules and
              libraries are</b>. They can save you time on a big project or even open up new possibilities for new
            projects; you can use them as long as you give credit to the creator.</p>

          <h6>Oh My Spikes!</h6>
          <p>Computer Science Principles</p>
          <p>September 23, 2019 - October 8, 2019</p>
          <p>Game: Balance the bird in the center of the screen and try to make it to the sides of the screen while
            simultaneously avoiding spikes, try to get the highest score!</p>
          <p>Background: This project was completely built within the MIT App Inventor, a web-integrated Andriod
            development platform. Me and my partner, Dustin Sun, were tasked with the challenge of modifying an already-developed game within two weeks while recording and documenting every step along the way. The communication
            part proved to be a difficulty since the only way to cooperate is to constantly save and share that modified
            version. Sometimes when we forget to check the update log, we would end up working on an outdated version
            and have to manually rewrite our code on the updated version. Through these miscommunications, we <b>learned
              to communicate better</b> and to be more careful when we modify our code. Aside from improving my
            communication skills, it <b>taught me about the different types of algorithms</b> and how to make them.</p>

            that I was not very experienced with coding while my partner was an expert. The difference in our knowledge
            made it difficult for us to split the work but <b>I still found a way to contribute</b> by developing the
