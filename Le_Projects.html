            <p>February 10, 2021 - March 7,2021</p>
            <p>Background: The goal for this project was to create a product made out of recyclable materials that can be sold in the market. Every year, 250 million tons of trash is thrown away by America alone. If we can find other ways to reuse plastic we can reduce the amount of trash polluting our oceans. Throughout this project, I <b>learned how to set deadlines</b> and <b>manage a team of people</b>. Moreover, this project has also <b>reminded me of the pollution problem on our planet</b>. If we continue to fill up our landfills at this rate; Eventually, we will run out of space to put our trash. For this reason, we must find new ways to limit our trash output and recycle when we can.</p>

            <p>Background: This project was built using Python and the Pillow library. The goal of this project was to modify images to satisfy a client's requirements; our client tasked us with creating borders around images. At the beginning of the project, I had trouble coding with the Pillow library and had to constantly look up the documentation. Through this process though, <b>I had familiarized myself with the documentation and got better at researching</b>. Another lesson that I learned from this project was <b>how useful modules and libraries are</b>. They can save you time on a big project or even open up new possibilities for new projects, you can use them as long as you give credit to the creator.</p>

            <p>Game: Balance the bird in the center of the screen and try to make it to the sides of the screen while simultaneously avoiding spikes, try to get the highest score!</p>
            <p>Background: This project was completely built within the MIT App Inventor, a web integrated Andriod development platform. Me and my partner, Dustin Sun, were tasked with the challenge of modifying an already developed game within two weeks while recording and documenting every step along the way. The communication part proved to be a difficulty since the only way to cooperate is to constantly save and share that modified version. Sometimes when we forget to check the update log, we would end up working on an outdated version and have to manually rewrite our code on the updated version. Through these miscommunications, we <b>learned to communicate better</b> and to be more careful when we modify our code. Aside from improving my communication skills, it <b>taught me about the different types of algorithms</b> and how to make them.</p>

            <p>Game: Use your reflexes and quick thinking to progress through the levels with the best time.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Background: This project was built inside the Scratch engine, a visual block coding platform. This project was the first coding project that was assigned to me at school, <b>it introduced me to coding and the engineering process</b> by tasking me to create an application on Scratch. A challenge that I faced was that I was not very experienced with coding while my partner was an expert. The difference in our knowledge made it difficult for us to split the work but <b>I still found a way to contribute</b> by developing the levels.</p>
