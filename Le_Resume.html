            <p>Influential Speakers:</p>
            <p>Cesar Nicola - Cesar Nicola is a software engineer at Blue Trail Software and he talked about his experiences with agile development. He described how agile development is centered around high efficiency, human interaction, and flexibility. Nicola talked about having “sprints” which were 30 minute periods of pure development/coding every single day. After these sprints, his team would come together and have stand-up meetings to share their progress or possibly find ways to improve their efficiency. Overall, Nicola’s presentation gave me insight on modern management methodologies and what I can expect in an engineering job today.</p>
            <p>Joe Vierra - Joe Vierra has managed tech startups for over 30 years and he talked about what things are important in starting a new tech company. First of all, he explained that patents are not going to stop people from copying your idea and that it is mainly useful when a big company wants to buy the permissions to your product. He also talked about the 90/10 rule: 10% of software will cause 90% of the problems. The third thing that he shared with us is how to find the right people who will work for you: find people who are compatible with you and balance your team between IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and EQ (Emotional Quotient). All in all, Vierra’s speech gave me insight on what to expect when starting a new company and what type of people I should be looking to hire if I start a company.</p>
