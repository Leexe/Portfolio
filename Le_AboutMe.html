           <p class="text-left">When I was little, I was always interested in how a computer works internally. This interest has always stuck with me for the rest of my years in school, it led me to where I am now. With the interest I have in computers I hope to create or contribute to something that will benefit people from all over the world. I plan to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science to further my knowledge about computers, I will then apply for a job in a software company to get a consistent income. Throughout these years I will keep creating applications that will either enhance my knowledge or will be beneficial to people around the world.</p>
           <p>I excel in a group environment through my open-mindedness and dedication to a cause. When a group is first formed together, people are usually defensive and not willing to open up with others. I combat this by being the first one to talk and by asking others to share things about themselves, I try to create a strong foundation for the group to excel.</p>
           <p>I had always enjoyed doing math but when I first moved to a higher math course, my view of math changed. I felt like I was being bombarded with material that I couldn't understand. To make matters worse, I didn't have someone to support me when I was struggling. No matter how hard I tried, the test would constantly get harder and updated with new material. In the end, I had managed to pass the course and continue on an advanced math path. Throughout my initial struggle, I had developed new study habits that I would still use today. Additionally, it taught me that the early stages of mastery is often grueling but is essential to the growth of that skill.</p>
           <p>To summarize, my goal is to be able to impact the world in a meaningful way through my creations. I am valuable in a group environment and that I have learned to persevere in times of struggle. Thank you for taking the time to read about me, I encourage you to keep exploring my website to learn more about me.</p>
