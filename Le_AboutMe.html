          <p class="text-left"><b>Description:</b></p>
          <p class="text-left">When I was little, I was always interested in how a computer works internally. This interest has stuck with me for the rest of my years in school; it led me to where I am now. With this interest, I hope to create and contribute to something that will benefit people all over the world. I plan to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science to further my knowledge about computers and become a software engineer. Throughout my life, I will continue to create applications that enhance my knowledge and bring happiness into others' lives.</p>
           <p>I excel in group environments with my open-mindedness and dedication to get the job done. When a group forms, people are usually defensive and unwilling to open up with others. To combat this, I will take the lead and strike up a conversation about something the group has in common. By taking the initiative, I build trust and create a strong foundation for the group to excel. Throughout a project, I make sure to take care of my responsibilities first so that I can ask for help early if I am having trouble or assist my teammates so that we can complete our final product on time.</p>
           <p>I had always enjoyed doing math. However, when I first moved to a higher math class, I was bombarded with material I couldn't understand. To make matters worse, my immigrant parents could not help me with my studies as they had to work most of the day to pay off rent and had little experience with the U.S. educational system. I felt that no matter how hard I tried, the test would constantly get harder and updated with new material. In the end, I managed to pass the course and continue on an advanced math path. Throughout my struggle, I developed invaluable study habits that I still utilize to succeed in my classes and it taught me that the early stages of mastery are often grueling but essential to the growth of that skill.</p>
           <p>To summarize, my goal is to impact the world in a meaningful way with my creations through my love of math and computers. Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I encourage you to keep exploring my website to discover more about me and my accomplishments.</p>
