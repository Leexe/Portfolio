          <ul>
            <li>I can lead a small group of people and make sure all deadlines are meet</li>
            <li>I am a self-motivated student who is able to keep myself in check</li>
            <li>I am also a naturally curious person who is open to new ideas and criticism</li>
          </ul> 
          <p class="text-left"><b>Description:</b></p>
          <p class="text-left">When I was little, I was always interested in how a computer works internally. This interest has stuck with me for the rest of my years in school; it led me to where I am now. With this interest, I hope to create and contribute to something that will benefit people from all over the world. I plan to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science to further my knowledge about computers. I will then apply for a job in a software company to get a consistent income stream. Throughout my life, I will keep creating applications that will enhance my knowledge or will be beneficial to people around the world.</p>
           <p>I excel in group environments with my open-mindedness and dedication to get the job done. When a group is first formed, people are usually defensive and unwilling to open up with others. To combat this, I will speak up first to start a conversation with my teammates. By taking the initiative, I build trust and create a strong foundation for the group to excel.</p>
           <p>I had always enjoyed doing math. However, when I first moved to a higher math course; I felt like I was bombarded with material that I couldn't understand. To make matters worse, I didn't have someone to support me when I was struggling. No matter how hard I tried, the test would constantly get harder and updated with new material. In the end, I had managed to pass the course and continue on an advanced math path. Throughout my struggle, I developed new study habits that I still utilize til today. Additionally, it taught me that the early stages of mastery is often grueling but is essential to the growth of that skill.</p>
           <p>To summarize, my goal is to impact the world in a meaningful way with my creations. I am valuable in a group environment by taking the initiative. I learned to persevere in times of struggle. Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I encourage you to keep exploring my website to discover more about me and my accomplishments.</p>
