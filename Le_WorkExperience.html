            <p>As a member of the Dublin High's Engineering Academy, I am provided with opportunities to go on field trips and learn from people who have succeeded in their field of work. Here are some notable experiences that I thought were insightful or interesting: </p>

            <p style="font-size:16px;"><b>Guest Speakers:</b></p>
            <p><b>Donald James (2021) </b>- Donald James is the Associate Administrator of Education for NASA, he came to Dublin High School to talk about his work experiences at NASA and to answer students' questions about STEM. In his presentation, James describes how he learned good "manners" from his mother and believes that "manners" is an important trait to succeed in the STEM field. He explains how smarts and communication skills are also essential to how "manners" is the trait that makes people like you and respects you, resulting in more opportunities and promotions.</p>
            <p><b>Trisha Shah (2021) </b>- Trisha Shah graduated from the Dublin Engineering Academy and studied at San Diego State University. She spoke about how in college, she had to switch majors often to find a subject that she was interested in and she still expresses this doubt in her presentation. Though in the end, she stated how "Hard Work Pays Off" and how we should not be afraid to switch majors in college if we are not interested in our current major. Listening to Trisha Shah's story helped me eliviate the belief that I would be stuck in the major I applied to in college.</p>
            <p><b>Cesar Nicola (2019)</b> - Cesar Nicola is a software engineer at Blue Trail Software who talked about his experiences with agile development. He described how agile development centers around high efficiency, human interaction, and flexibility. Nicola described his experiences with “sprints,” which were 30 minute periods of pure development/coding every single day. After these sprints, his team would come together and have stand-up meetings to share their progress or possibly find ways to improve their efficiency. Overall, Nicola’s presentation gave me insight into modern management methodologies and what I can expect in an engineering job today.</p>
            <p><b>Joe Vierra (2019)</b> - Joe Vierra has managed tech startups for over 30 years; his presentation described things that are essential to start a new tech company. He explained that patents are not going to stop people from copying your idea and that it is mainly useful when a big company wants to buy the permissions for your product. Vierra also talked about the 90/10 rule: 10% of software will cause 90% of the problems. The third thing that he shared with us is how to find the right people who will work for you: find people who are compatible with you and balance your team between IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and EQ (Emotional Quotient). All in all, Vierra’s speech gave me insight into what to expect when starting a new company and what type of people I should be looking to hire if I start a company.</p>

            <p style="font-size:16px;"><b>Field Trips:</b></p>
            <p><b>Dig Deep Farms (2022)</b> - On this field trip, I went on a trip to see a farm in San Leandro, California, that was utilizing sustainable agricultural practices to run their farms. Rather than artificially altering the farm by using pesticides, they built their farm around nature by planting crops such as lavender and marigold flowers that naturally repel plants and other crops that hold the predators of the pests. I was also able to take a closer look at the different tractor attachments that they use to increase farm efficentcy: they have an attachment that holds two people ontop of it and makes holes in the soil so that the farmers can drop seeds. Overall, this field trip gave me insight into the world of sustainable farming by allowing me to watch and study these practices work up close.</p>
            <p><b>Clorox Research Plant (2022)</b> - Clorox Plant - On this field trip, I traveled to a local Clorox research plant that focused on innovating consumer products such as wipes and toilet disinfectants. At that plant, I witnessed the many test environments and rooms that they used to sample their products. For example, they had a room filled with washers that they used to test their detergents and a room filled with modified toilets that displayed information such as water pressure. After the plant showcase, they had a Q&A session with the Clorox engineers about their college experiences and their first job experiences. I was able to learn about how the first internship you get is hugely dependent on your grades but after that, all your job interviews will depend on your past work experience.</p>
            <p><b>Oracle NA Job Shadow (2021)</b> - The Oracle Job Shadow introduced me to various people with different positions and jobs at the company. I was able to hear from an employer who told us what she looks for in her employees. She says that engineers need to be intelligent and have good communication skills; they also need to be able to get their ideas across well. Additionally, a person who worked in human resources taught me to be mindful of what I wear to work and research the company before interviews. Overall, this field trip was memorable since it exposed me to many different professions and how they all work together in the company.</p>
            <p><b>JA Tech & Innovation Summit (2021)</b> - In this virtual field trip, I heard representatives from different companies like Amazon and SalesForce speak about their jobs and early career choices. One speaker was a product manager at Salesforce. He told us how he helps companies roll out their product and manage their engineers; despite knowing little about programming. I learned how you need to be good at other skills like public speaking and leadership to succeed in the tech industry. Another speaker from Amazon talked about how she did not know what career she was going into until the middle of college. Overall, she told us to be open to other careers and that we are not locked to the major that we chose in college.</p>

          <p style="font-size:16px;"><b>Mentorship Program:</b></p>
          <p>For the mentorship program, my primary mentor was Saini Amar, who is a data scientist at Lawrance Livermore Labs, and my secondary mentor was Rupert Young, who is leading a team of engineers to solve security threats online at Neustar. My mentors and I went through practice interviews and resume-building sessions to help me get a taste of what it's like in the professional world. One key takeaway that I got from these meetings was to create questions for the interviewer before an interview to show them that you know what you are talking about and that you are interested in the position. Another key takeaway I learned from my mentors was to make my resume visually appealing to separate myself from other applicants and to hold onto the employer's attention for a longer period of time. All in all, I am grateful for my mentors and the skills that they taught me.</p>
