            <p>As a member of the Dublin High's Engineering Academy, I am provided with opportunities to go on field trips and learn from people who have succeeded in their field of work. Here are some notable experiences that I thought were insightful or interesting: </p>

            <p style="font-size:16px;">Influential Speakers:</p>
            <p>Cesar Nicola - Cesar Nicola is a software engineer at Blue Trail Software who talked about his experiences with agile development. He described how agile development centers around high efficiency, human interaction, and flexibility. Nicola described his experiences with “sprints,” which were 30 minute periods of pure development/coding every single day. After these sprints, his team would come together and have stand-up meetings to share their progress or possibly find ways to improve their efficiency. Overall, Nicola’s presentation gave me insight into modern management methodologies and what I can expect in an engineering job today.</p>
            <p>Joe Vierra - Joe Vierra has managed tech startups for over 30 years; his presentation described things that are essential to start a new tech company. He explained that patents are not going to stop people from copying your idea and that it is mainly useful when a big company wants to buy the permissions to your product. Vierra also talked about the 90/10 rule: 10% of software will cause 90% of the problems. The third thing that he shared with us is how to find the right people who will work for you: find people who are compatible with you and balance your team between IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and EQ (Emotional Quotient). All in all, Vierra’s speech gave me insight into what to expect when starting a new company and what type of people I should be looking to hire if I start a company.</p>

            <p style="font-size:16px;">Field Trips:</p>
            <p>Oracle NA Job Shadow - The Oracle Job Shadow introduced me to various people with different positions and jobs at the company. I was able to hear from an employer who told us what she looks for in her employees. She says that engineers need to be intelligent and have good communication skills; they need to get their ideas across well. Additionally, a person who worked at human resources taught me to be mindful of what I wear to work and research the company before interviews. Overall, this field trip was memorable since it exposed me to many different professions and how they all work together in the company.</p>
